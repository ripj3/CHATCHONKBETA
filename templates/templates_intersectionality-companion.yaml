# Intersectionality Companion Template for ChatChonk
# Purpose: Explores and documents personal experiences through an intersectional lens,
# examining how multiple aspects of identity interact to create unique lived experiences.
#
# Scholarly Note: This template is based on the framework of intersectionality developed by
# legal scholar Dr. Kimberl√© Crenshaw in 1989. Dr. Crenshaw's groundbreaking work illuminated
# how multiple social identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, class, disability) overlap
# and intersect, creating unique experiences of discrimination or privilege that cannot be
# understood by examining any single identity in isolation. This framework has been instrumental
# in advancing more nuanced understandings of social justice and identity across many disciplines.
