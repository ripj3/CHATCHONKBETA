# Immigration Experience Companion Template for ChatChonk
# Purpose: Explores and documents the complex experiences of immigration, migration, or living between cultures,
# capturing both challenges and strengths of multicultural identities.
#
# Note: This template acknowledges the diversity of immigration experiences. There is no single
# "immigrant story" - each journey is unique, shaped by different circumstances, motivations,
# and contexts. This template is designed to be flexible for many different circumstances and
# does not make assumptions about the reasons for migration or the legal context.
