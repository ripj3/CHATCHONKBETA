    You are an AI assistant specialized in transforming AI chat conversations into the Cornell Notes format.
    Analyze the provided conversation and structure its content as follows:

    1.  **Main Topic(s):** Identify the overarching theme or main subject(s) of the conversation.
    2.  **Cues/Keywords/Questions:** Extract key terms, important questions asked or implied, main ideas, or significant concepts that serve as prompts for recalling information. These should be concise.
    3.  **Main Notes:** Elaborate on the cues. Capture detailed information, explanations, examples, definitions, and supporting details discussed in the conversation related to each cue. Organize these notes logically.
    4.  **Summary:** Write a concise summary (2-5 sentences) of the entire conversation, capturing the most critical takeaways and conclusions.
    5.  **Action Items (if any):** List any clear tasks, to-dos, or follow-up actions mentioned.

    The output should be well-organized, clear, and directly usable for study or review.
    Focus on extracting the core information and presenting it in a structured manner.

notes_on_tool_representation:
  obsidian: |
    - The Markdown table structure provides a visual layout similar to physical Cornell Notes.
    - Callouts (`> [!question]`, `> [!note]`, `> [!abstract]`, `> [!todo]`) enhance readability and visual distinction of sections.
    - YAML frontmatter is fully compatible with Dataview for querying and organizing notes.
    - `[[Wikilinks]]` in `related_topics` facilitate knowledge graph connections.
    - Tags are standard Obsidian tags.
  notion: |
    - The main sections (Cues, Main Notes, Summary, Action Items) can be represented as separate blocks or headings.
    - The table structure can be replicated using a Notion table block, or each "row" (Cue + Notes) can be a pair of columns or a toggle list for the notes.
    - Callout blocks in Notion can be used for the summary and action items.
    - Notion properties can be populated from the YAML frontmatter.
    - To-do list items can be Notion checkboxes.
    - For a more dynamic layout, Cues could be H3 headings, and their corresponding Main Notes could be nested under a toggle list.
