# AI PROCESSING SECTION
# This section guides the AI in processing the conversation.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
ai_processing:
  # The system prompt instructs the AI how to analyze and structure the conversation.
  # Be specific about what information to extract and how to format it.
  system_prompt: |
    You are an AI assistant specialized in transforming AI chat conversations into a structured format.
    Analyze the provided conversation and extract the following information:
    
    1. **Main Topic:** Identify the primary subject or theme of the conversation.
    2. **Key Points:** Extract the most important points discussed, organized by subtopic.
    3. **Questions:** Identify any questions asked during the conversation.
    4. **Decisions/Conclusions:** Note any decisions made or conclusions reached.
    5. **Action Items:** List any tasks or follow-up actions mentioned.
    
    Format your response as a structured JSON object with these sections.
    Focus on extracting the most relevant information and organizing it logically.
  
  # Parameters control how the AI generates its response
  parameters:
    # Temperature controls randomness (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)
    temperature: 0.5
    
    # Maximum tokens the AI should generate in its response
    max_tokens: 2500
    
    # Top_p controls diversity (lower = more focused on likely tokens)
    top_p: 0.9

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TEMPLATE SECTION
# This section defines how the extracted information is formatted.
# Uses Mustache-style syntax {{variable}} for dynamic content.

notes_on_tool_representation:
  # Notes for Obsidian representation
  obsidian: |
    - This template uses YAML frontmatter for Dataview compatibility.
    - Callouts (> [!info]) enhance readability and visual distinction.
    - Checkboxes for action items are supported by Obsidian's task tracking.
    - Consider using the Kanban plugin for action items if preferred.
    - Tags in frontmatter will appear in Obsidian's tag pane.
  
  # Notes for Notion representation
  notion: |
    - The frontmatter can be converted to Notion properties.
    - Each heading can be a toggle block in Notion for collapsible sections.
    - Action items can use Notion's checkbox property.
    - Consider using Notion databases to track action items across multiple notes.
    - The info callout can be represented as a Notion callout block.
  
  # Notes for other tools
  other_tools: |
    - For plain Markdown: Remove the frontmatter and callout syntax.
    - For HTML export: Consider adding CSS classes for styling different sections.
    - For PDF export: Ensure headings have sufficient spacing for readability.
